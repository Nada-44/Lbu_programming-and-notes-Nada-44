## Why Software Engineering?
I chose Software Engineering because I really enjoy coding and solving problems. It can be challenging at times, but seeing the final result of my hard work makes it all worth it. I’m motivated by learning, improving, and creating things that actually work. People don't consider coding as creative but for me it's the most creative things ever, buliding something from scratch is amazing.
My dream is to continue getting better at coding and to build a successful career as a software engineer(*a place I belong too*).
